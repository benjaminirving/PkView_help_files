## Installation

Executables are available for Ubuntu, Windows and OSx. 

For OSx one dependency is not yet ready for high definition screens which leads to poorer resolution. 

## Basic Usage

#### Nifti 

This software package works with nifti volumes. Please convert dicoms to nifti first using one of a number of tools including: [itk-snap](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php), [dcm2nii](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage) or the batch version which allows a number of volumes to be converted [dcm2niibatch](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)

#### Load 4D volume

PKView loads images, rois and overlays from nifti files. 

Either: 

1) Drag and drop a 4D nifti file onto the viewer

or

2) File -> Load Image

![Image 1](screenshots/1.png)

When dragging and dropping, a window will pop up to specify whether the image is a 4D volume, ROI or overlay. 

![Image 2](screenshots/2.jpg)

The image will appear in the 3 views. 
Options
- Zoom using the **right mouse button**
- **Left mouse button** click a point
- **scroll** using the mouse wheel
- Options allow scaling based on the voxel size

#### Load ROI and overlays

Drag-and-drop or load overlays in a similar way.

For overlays specify the overlay type or a generic type (as show below)

![Image 1](screenshots/4.jpg)

Switch between loaded or generated overlays from the *current overlays* section of the **Volumes** widget. 

![Image 1](screenshots/5.png)


## General interaction

- Scroll mouse button to navigate through the volume
- Left click on a point to navigate through the volume
- Use the sliders at the bottom to navigate through the volume
- Double click on a window to expand (see below)

## Volume, ROI and overlay interaction

## Voxel analysis widget

- The voxel analysis widget gives the enhancement curve of the currently selected location. 

![Image 1](screenshots/6.png)

- Multiple points can be selected with multiple colors
- Mean curves for each color can be calculated
- Points can be cleared with X
![Image 1](screenshots/7.png)



## Saving images

#### Save a screen shot or plot
- Right click on an image or plot
- Click *Export*
- A view box will appear with the various format options. 
- *svg* format will allow editing of the layers and nodes in inkscape or another vector graphics viewer.

#### Save an overlay to nifti

File -> Save Current overlay

## Overlay statistics widget

- Statistics for each defined ROI
- Mean, Median, Variance, Min and Max

![Image 1](screenshots/Selection_177.jpg)


## Curve clustering widget

- PCA based curve clustering allows clustering of tumour subregions based on contrast enhancement characteristics. 
- Number of clusters
- PCA modes used for clustering
- Advanced options: Merge clusters, auto merge clusters, get cluster sizes

![Image 1](screenshots/10.png)


## Overlay clustering widget

- Cluster based on a particular ROI map
- Step 1: Select the overlay of interest

![Image 1](screenshots/13.png)

- Step 2: Cluster based on the selected ROI. 
- Get slice and volume statistics

![Image 1](screenshots/12.png)

## Supervoxel widget
Create supervoxel regions within an ROI (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09518v2)

![Image 1](screenshots/Selection_166.jpg)


## Mean value widget
Generate mean values from the current overlays for each ROI. 

*Example showing mean Ktrans value of each supervoxel*

![Image 1](screenshots/Selection_167.jpg)

## T1 mapping widget
Generate T1 maps from variable flip angle images (used as a preprocessing step for PK modelling)

*Using a single 4D volume with multiple flip angles*
![Image 1](screenshots/Selection_181.jpg)

*Loading muliple flip angle volumes*
![Image 1](screenshots/Screenshot_3.png)


## PK modelling widget

- Load DCE-MRI, ROI and T10 map
- Select pharamacokinetic model
- Input image parameters
- Run modelling inside the ROI

*Start of modelling*
![Image 1](screenshots/Screenshot_2.png)

*Modelling complete with newly generated Ktrans map*
![Image 1](screenshots/Screenshot_1.png)

*Still required:*
- Inclusion of Contrast-to-noise ratio restriction

## Visualisation of model fit widget
- *Additional Widgets -> PharmCurveView*
- If Pk modelling has been run or *model curves* are loaded from a nifti file then visualise the difference in parameters between the model fit and the true data.
