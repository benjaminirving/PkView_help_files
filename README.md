## Installation

Executables are available for Ubuntu, Windows and OSx. 


## Basic Usage

#### Load 4D volume

PKView loads images, rois and overlays from nifti files. 

Either: 

1) Drag and drop a 4D nifti file onto the viewer

or

2) File -> Load 

![Image 1](screenshots/1.png)

When dragging and dropping, a window will pop up to specify whether the image is a 4D volume, ROI or overlay.

The image will appear in the 3 views. 
Options
- Zoom using the **right mouse button**
- **Left mouse button** click a point
- **scroll** using the mouse wheel
- Options allow scaling based on the voxel size
